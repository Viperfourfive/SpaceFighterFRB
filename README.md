# SpaceFighterFRB

A Geometry Wars like clone.  I'm using this project to familiaze myself with the FlatRedBall framework, XNA 4.0, and C#.  Feel free to fork and play or fork and make your own changes :)

Input mapped is to a Xbox 360 controller or keyboard.  

XBox360: Left stick to move & Right stick to shoot.

Keyboard: WASD to move & Arrow keys to shoot.
